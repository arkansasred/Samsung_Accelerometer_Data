Samsung_Accelerometer_Data
==========================
Assuming you have the data(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) in your working directory in R, you just run:
  source('run_analysis.R')
  run_analysis()

This will save a tidyData.txt file to your working directory
